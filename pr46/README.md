#Goldbach's other conjecture | https://projecteuler.net/problem=46

##Problem Statement



It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
```
9 = 7 + 2×1^2
15 = 7 + 2×2^2
21 = 3 + 2×3^2
25 = 7 + 2×3^2
27 = 19 + 2×2^2
33 = 31 + 2×1^2
```
It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
